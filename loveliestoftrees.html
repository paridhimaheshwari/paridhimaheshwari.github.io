<body bgcolor="yellow" text="green">
<p align=center>Loveliest of trees, the cherry now <br>
is hung with bloom along the bough<br>
And take from seventy springs a score <br>
Wearing white for Eastertide <br>
</p>
<p align=center>Now, of my threesome years and tea, <br>
Twenty will not come again, <br>
And take from seventy springs a score <br>
It only leaves me fifty more <br>
</p>
<p align=center>And since to look at thongs at bloom, <br>
Fifty springs are little room,<br>
About the woodlands I will go <br>
To see the cherry hung with snow<br>
